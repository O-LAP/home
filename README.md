# O-LAP  
Open source computational furniture
We write code which creates furniture designs programmatically.  
An open-source community run platform for designers to experiment with this concept.

## What is O-LAP?
O-LAP is an open-source set of tools to build parameterizable models of flat-pack style furniture.  
We are trying to build a community around this idea.  

## How does it work?  

O-LAP is part exploration into a new way in thinking and working with design.  
Designers create parametric furniture designs as 'plugins' into the framework.  
Registered designs gets displayed in the gallery.  
Users can view the designs from the gallery and customize it based on the customization enabled by the designer.  
Users can extract CAD files which can be used to fabricate the design using a CNC machine.  
Community moderates the design collection.

## Technology Stack

### Software
We are built on foundations of Javascript, Git and the Web.
We maintain an open-source web based framework.  
Designers create their designs like plugins into the framework.  
Each design is maintained by their owners as a public Git repository with full ownership.  
To link it to the main O-LAP web app, they make a pull request to inform the community about their design.  
Community moderators make sure the design conform to the standards.  
When a user opens a design, the design code is directly fetched from the owners repository and is processed on user's browser.  
It's all a network of git repositories and javascript on the client-side.  
Community enforced guidelines ensure designs are functional, presentable and manufacturable using an open fabrication process.  

### Fabrication
The users can extract fabrication drawings from the design which can be used for digital fabrication.  
We enable the standards so anyone can make our designs.  

## How can you get involved?
### Contribute Design
Learn how you can [make your first design](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/quick-start.md).  
To get started you can clone the [starter project](https://github.com/O-LAP/starter_project).  
We highly encourage you to read the [guidelines](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/guidelines.md) for this project before submitting a design.  

### Maintain
[Open Tasks](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/projects)

### Manage
We are an open-source community and need community curation to make everything work.  
We are looking for people who can take up different roles.

## Current Stage  
This is day one on the block and in no way is it ready.  
But it's an intitative to put the idea out.  
Use the slack group to discuss.
