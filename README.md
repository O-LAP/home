# O-LAP  
Open source computational furniture
We write code which creates furniture designs programmatically.  
We are an open-source community run platform for designers to experiment with this concept.

## What is Comptational Design?
Computational design is a field within the practice of design, where designers write algorithms which create or assist in design.  
It is an umbrella term and encompasses parts of graphics, data analysis, digital fabrication, CAD designing and alike.  

## What is O-LAP?
O-lap is an open-source set of tools to build parameterizable models of flat-pack style furniture.  
We are trying to build a community around this idea.

## The Technology

O-lap is part exploration into a new way in thinking and working with design.  

### Software
We are built on foundations of Javascript, Git and the Web.
We maintain an open-source web based framework.  
Designers create their designs like plugins into the framework.  
Each design is maintained by their owners as a public Git repository with full ownership.  
To link it to the main O-LAP web app, they make a pull request to inform the community about their design.  
When a user opens a design, the design code is directly fetched from the owners repository and is processed on user's browser.  
It's all a network of git repositories and javascript on the client-side.  
Community enforced guidelines ensure designs are functional, presentable and manufacturable using our open fabrication process.  

### Fabrication
The users can then extract fabrication drawings from the design which can be used for digital fabrication.  
We enable the standards so anyone can make our designs.  

## How can you get involved?
### Contribute Design
Learn how you can [make your first design](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/quick-start.md).  
To get started you can clone the [starter project](https://github.com/O-LAP/starter_project).  
We highly encourage you to read the [guidelines](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/guidelines.md) and the [vision](https://O-LAP.github.io/vision.md) for this project before you submitting a design.  
To submit designs to be added to the gallery you make a pull request to this project.  

### Maintain
[Open Tasks](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/tasks.md)

### Manage
We are an open-source community and need community curation to make everything work.  
We are looking for people who can take up different roles. While we build our process reach out directly to get in touch or for fork and suggest.

## Current Stage  
This is day one on the block and in no way is it ready.  
But it's an intitative to put the idea out.  
Going foward we will focus on the following for developing the framework.  
- Testing
Making sure everything works everywhere as they should.  
- Feedback Development
Hear more for designers/developers to make changes that are reasonable.
- Production Standards
The designs we envision to make need to be fabricated anywhere. So having a coherent standard will be useful for all.  
- Enforcing Standards
We hope designers will fabricate and test their designs before publishing. We plan to encourage this by developing an incentive for them to do so.

It is a one person effort, looking for more collaborators. You can reach me at [this](amit.lzkpa@gmail.com) link.
