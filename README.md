# O-LAP  
Open source computational furniture
We write code which creates furniture designs programmatically.  
We are an open-source community run platform for designers to experiment with this concept.

## What is Computational Design?
Computational design is a field within the practice of design, where designers write algorithms which create or assist in design.  
It is an umbrella term and encompasses parts of graphics, data analysis, digital fabrication, CAD designing and alike.  

## What is O-LAP?
O-LAP is an open-source set of tools to build parameterizable models of flat-pack style furniture.  
We are trying to build a community around this idea.

## The Technology

O-LAP is part exploration into a new way in thinking and working with design.  

### Software
We are built on foundations of Javascript, Git and the Web.
We maintain an open-source web based framework.  
Designers create their designs like plugins into the framework.  
Each design is maintained by their owners as a public Git repository with full ownership.  
To link it to the main O-LAP web app, they make a pull request to inform the community about their design.  
When a user opens a design, the design code is directly fetched from the owners repository and is processed on user's browser.  
It's all a network of git repositories and javascript on the client-side.  
Community enforced guidelines ensure designs are functional, presentable and manufacturable using our open fabrication process.  

### Fabrication
The users can then extract fabrication drawings from the design which can be used for digital fabrication.  
We enable the standards so anyone can make our designs.  

## How can you get involved?
### Contribute Design
Learn how you can [make your first design](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/quick-start.md).  
To get started you can clone the [starter project](https://github.com/O-LAP/starter_project).  
We highly encourage you to read the [guidelines](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/guidelines.md) for this project before you submitting a design.  

### Maintain
[Open Tasks](https://github.com/O-LAP/home/blob/master/tasks.md)

### Manage
We are an open-source community and need community curation to make everything work.  
We are looking for people who can take up different roles.

## Current Stage  
This is day one on the block and in no way is it ready.  
But it's an intitative to put the idea out.  
Use the slack group to discuss.
