# Vision

## Inspire Creativity
This is a new way about thiking about furniture design. It's a platform where designers can experiment with new ideas.  
We have worked on designs which let the user customize a design for themselves. But we are curious to see what else can be done.  

## Honesty in Design
With the workflow we use for design, the design narrative is public and is recorded with the growth of the design.  
The growth of the design is documented and all designs are openly subject to criticisms and praise.  

## Evolving Designs
We promote the community to keep their designs and ideas open, so other designers who are inspired from any design can take it and modify it or rework it.  
We believe this will create an environment where designs start behaving like living organisms which evolve and birth new designs inspired by themselves.   
It will allow a design to be adapted and used by a smaller community based on their preferences or constraints.  
We believe this open atmosphere will also get the best designs to the forefront - survival of the fittest.  

## Democratizing Design
Furniture designs currently have a high entry barrier due the resources required to manufacture your designs at scale.  
A designer needs to have a studio and manage fabrication or align with a company to try to bring his/her designs out to the market.  
While we can't do all kinds of designs our process can enable more upstarts to present their designs and let the community decide.  

## More Inclusive
The design, manufacture and supply chain has been a closed loop system owned entirely by individual entities.  
By breaking apart these aspects we think we can involve more independent participants to contribute and gain from this process while still keeping the whole process sustainable.  
Our model can't run on mega factories to achieve economies of scale.  

## Promote Openness
Our framework is open and we encourage all designs to be open. We are keen to involve more people in the process.  
We believe openness to be a more effecient system of achieving a greater good over the longer term.
