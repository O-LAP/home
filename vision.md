# Vision

## Inspire Creativity
This is a new way about thiking about furniture design. It's a platform where designers can experiment with new ideas.  

## Honesty in Design
With the workflow we use for design, the design narrative is public and is recorded with the growth of the design.  
The growth of the design is documented and all designs are openly available.  

## Evolving Designs
Designs and ideas open, so other designers who are inspired from any design can take it and modify it or rework it.  
It will allow a design to be adapted and used by anyone based on their preferences or constraints.  

## Democratizing Design
Furniture designs currently have a high entry barrier due the resources required to manufacture your designs at scale.  
A designer needs to have a studio and manage fabrication or align with a company to try to bring his/her designs out to the market.  

## Promote Openness
Our framework is open and we encourage all designs to be open. We are keen to involve more people in the process.  
We believe openness to be a more effecient system of achieving a greater good over the longer term.
