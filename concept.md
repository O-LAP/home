# The Concept
Open source computational furniture
We write code which creates furniture designs programmatically.  
We are an open-source community run platform for designers to experiment with this concept.

## What is Comptational Design?
Computational design is a field within the practice of design, where designers write algorithms which create or assist in design.  
It is an umbrella term and encompasses parts of graphics, data analysis, digital fabrication, CAD designing and alike.  
Basically, it is the use of computational strategies in any way that helps design.  

## What do we do?
We use the `Comptational Design` approach to create furniture designs.  
We use computational strategies in every aspect of the furniture design - design, production and use.  

## Why we do it?
It is fun. We are crazy.  
When code creates the design, it opens up a new window of possibilities.  
The designs are customizable - the code lets the user tweak the design to his taste before getting it made.  
The designs are high precision - the designs are precise to the tenth of an mm, so designers can make designs which are remarkably accurate.  
The designs can be mailed - the standardized production processes ensure the same design is recreated whenever fabricated.  
It is sustainable - we hope that by reducing the transport of furniture and more efficient material use we can reduce its impact on earth.  
A more inclusive production process - we believe we can involve more independent participants in the design and manufacture of furniture, distributing the benefits.  
Inspiring creativity - this way of exploring furniture design is radically new and even we are not sure what to expect.  

## How we do it?
We are a community.  
We write code that can create furniture designs in your internet browser.  
The same code also outputs a digital fabrication drawing for the design.  
These files can be fed into digital fabrication machines (think 3D printing) to manufacture the designs.  

## Can you explain the technology

### Software
We are built on foundations of Javascript, Git and the Web.
We maintain an open-source web based framework.  
Designers create their designs like plugins into the framework.  
Each design is maintained by their owners as a public Git repository with full ownership.  
To link it to the main O-LAP web app, they make a pull request to inform the community about their design.  
Community enforced guidelines ensure designs are functional, presentable and manufacturable using our 'open' production process.  
When a user views our gallery they see a list of all the designs the community has collected.  
When they open a design, the design is directly fetched from the owners repository.  
The users can then create extract fabrication drawings from the designs which can be digitally fabricated.  
Main Repo: `https://github.com/O-LAP/home.git`

### Fabrication
We adopt a process called digital fabrication for producing the designs.  
There is no factory. The code we write ensures that every design can output a computer fabrication drawing of the design.  
This drawing can be fed into a digital fabrication machine (CNC machine) which creates parts of the design. The user assembles the pieces to make his furniture.  
Standardized materials and process ensure that the designs are identical wherever they are fabricated.  
We don't really 'manufacture' the designs. We enable the standards so anyone can make our designs.
